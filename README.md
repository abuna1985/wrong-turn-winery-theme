## Summary

A custom WordPress theme for a winery. Uses Bootstrap 4, SCSS, AutoPrefixer, and Gulp for all processing tasks. Included custom posts like Wines, Events, Locations, Staff, and Notes.  Built a search page that uses the WP REST API and ES6 JavaScript to search all pages, posts, and custom posts. Syncs changes across local development devices with BrowserSync. Tested up to WordPress 5.1.

## Usage

The theme is setup to use [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to compile SCSS (with source maps), run it through [Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer), lint, concatenate and minify JavaScript (with source maps), optimize images, and syncs changes across local development devices with [BrowserSync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-sync), with flexibility to add any additional tasks via the `gulpfile.js`.

### Features

1. Media Queries can be nested in each selector using SASS.
2. SCSS with plenty of mixins ready to go.
3. Gulp for processing all SASS, JavaScript and images, and cross-device refreshing with BrowserSync.
4. Search page made with WP REST API and ES6 JavaScript to search all pages, posts, and custom posts.
